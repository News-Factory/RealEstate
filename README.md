# RealEstate

This is the bulk of the code for the "Nadlan/Real Estate" project as of 25/01/2021.
This master branch needs to be cleaned/organized in order to be:

- 1) Easier to navigate
- 2) Render the functions more "universal" (adding input values)

The end point is to have a central "master" with pre-defined functions that will be used in all future projects
and many smaller branches where individual adjustments are made.
