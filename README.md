Code fully working on the TRANSPARENT AfterEffects project in a "batch" fashion (more than one txt processed at the time) as of today 25/01/2020.
Needs some re-working for the Red&Blue, which will probably become a new branch.

The end point is to have a central "master" with pre-defined functions that will be used in all future projects
and many smaller branches where individual adjustments are made.
